## Curation - Building Your Own Knowledge Graph

### 🧑‍🔬 Curation of BioMedical Knowledges for Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia (CIT)

> Goal: curate latest findings from literatures and build a knowledgebase for Thrombocytopenia. It may complete the knowledge graph for thrombocytopenia.
> 
> Category: Knowledge Curation; Database;

> Description:

> Group Members: Zhixing Zhu, Xiuwen Chen, Feng Zhu, Mingming Li

> Publication:

> Website: [Thrombocytopenia Knowledgebase](https://prophet-studio.3steps.cn)

### 🧑‍🔬 Curation of BioMedical Knowledges for ME/CFS and Long COVID

> Goal: curate latest findings from literatures and build a knowledgebase for ME/CFS and Long COVID. These findings include drug targets, disease mechanisms and biomarkers. It may help us to train deep learning models to curate knowledges automatically and be part of the knowledge graph for drug repurposing, disease mechanism and biomarker screening.
