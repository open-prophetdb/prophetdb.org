## 📝 Ongoing Research Projects - 2023

### 🧑‍🔬 Curation of BioMedical Knowledges for Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia (CIT)

Goal: curate latest findings from literatures and build a knowledgebase for Thrombocytopenia. It may complete the knowledge graph for thrombocytopenia.

Group members: Zhixing Zhu, Xiuwen Chen, Feng Zhu, Mingming Li

### 🧑‍🔬 Curation of BioMedical Knowledges for ME/CFS and Long COVID

Goal: curate latest findings from literatures and build a knowledgebase for ME/CFS and Long COVID. These findings include drug targets, disease mechanisms and biomarkers. It may help us to train deep learning models to curate knowledges automatically and be part of the knowledge graph for drug repurposing, disease mechanism and biomarker screening.

Group members: Yuchen Ye, Yurong Zhao

### 🕸️ Building of BioMedical Knowledge Graph and Graph Neural Network for Drug Repurposing

Goal: build a common biomedical knowledge graph for drug repurposing, disease mechanism and biomarker screening.

Group members: Jingcheng Yang, Penghao Xu

### 🧬 Building of sgRNA database for CRISPR/Cas9

Goal: curate all sgRNAs from literatures and develop an online database.

Group members: Fanhao Zhou, Yiming Cai, Zijing Ma, Xiuwen Chen
