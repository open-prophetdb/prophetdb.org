# 📝 Ongoing Research Projects - 2023

## Curation - Building Your Own Knowledge Graph

### 🧑‍🔬 Curation of BioMedical Knowledges for Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia (CIT)

> Goal: curate latest findings from literatures and build a knowledgebase for Thrombocytopenia. It may complete the knowledge graph for thrombocytopenia.

> Group Members: Zhixing Zhu, Xiuwen Chen, Feng Zhu, Mingming Li

> Publication:

> Website: [Thrombocytopenia Knowledgebase](https://prophet-studio.3steps.cn)

### 🧑‍🔬 Curation of BioMedical Knowledges for ME/CFS and Long COVID

> Goal: curate latest findings from literatures and build a knowledgebase for ME/CFS and Long COVID. These findings include drug targets, disease mechanisms and biomarkers. It may help us to train deep learning models to curate knowledges automatically and be part of the knowledge graph for drug repurposing, disease mechanism and biomarker screening.

# 📝 Finished Research Projects

## 🧑‍🔬 GlioMarker: An Integrated Database for Knowledge Exploration of Diagnostic Biomarkers in Gliomas

>  <img alt="GlioMarker" src="/assets/images/gliomarker.png" width="100%" />

> Category: Database; Knowledge Curation

> Description: GlioMarker is the first diagnostic biomarker database in the field of gliomas to provide biomarker knowledge exploration, including comprehensive literature mining, ontology annotations, precision medical knowledge exploration, and online omics data analysis and visualization. It may serve as a specialist ploatform for clinicians and researchers by providing rapid and comprehensive knowledge, which in turn will facilitate high-quality research and biomarker applications.
