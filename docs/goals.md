## 📝 Research Goals

- Build a network medicine platform for drug repurposing and disease mechanism for human diseases, such as ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc.

- Find drug targets, disease mechanisms and potential drugs for rare diseases, such as ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc. 

## 📚 Research Tasks

> Rare Disease: ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc.

### 🧑‍🔬 Curating BioMedical Knowledges and Omics Data

- Curate multi-omics data and knowledge from public databases and literatures for `rare diseases`.

### 🕸️ Building BioMedical Knowledge Graph

- Build a biomedical knowledge graph for drug repurposing and disease mechanism for `rare diseases`.
