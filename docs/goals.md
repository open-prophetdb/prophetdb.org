## 📝 Research Goals

Construct and integrate <b>knowledge graph</b>, <b>multi-omics data</b> and <b>deep learning models</b> to understand the molecular mechanisms of human rare and complex diseases, or to predict new indications for known drugs through drug repurposing.

## 📚 Research Tasks

> Rare and complex diseases, such as ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc.
