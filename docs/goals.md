## 📝 Research Goals

Construct and integrate <b>knowledge graph</b>, <b>multi-omics data</b> and <b>deep learning models</b> to understand the molecular mechanisms of human diseases or predict known drugs for new indications (Drug Repurposing).

## 📚 Research Tasks

> Auto-immune diseases, such as ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc.

### 🧑‍🔬 Curating BioMedical Knowledges and Omics Data

- Curate multi-omics data and knowledge from public databases and literatures for `auto-immune diseases`.

### 🕸️ Building BioMedical Knowledge Graph

- Build a biomedical knowledge graph for drug repurposing and disease mechanism for `auto-immune diseases`.
