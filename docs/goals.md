## 📝 Research Goals

Construct and integrate knowledge graph, multi-omics data and deep learning models to understand the molecular mechanisms of human diseases or predict known drugs for new indications (Drug Repurposing).

## 📚 Research Tasks

> Diseases: ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc.

### 🧑‍🔬 Curating BioMedical Knowledges and Omics Data

- Curate multi-omics data and knowledge from public databases and literatures for `rare diseases`.

### 🕸️ Building BioMedical Knowledge Graph

- Build a biomedical knowledge graph for drug repurposing and disease mechanism for `rare diseases`.
