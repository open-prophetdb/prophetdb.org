## 📝 Research Goals

OpenProphetDB is an open research group focused on unlocking the potential of existing drugs to save patients with rare and complex diseases. We explore the following topics: constructing and integrating knowledge graph, multi-omics data, and deep learning models to understand the molecular mechanisms of human rare and complex diseases, or to predict new indications for known drugs through drug repurposing.

## 📚 Research Tasks

> Rare and complex diseases, such as ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc.

### 🧑‍🔬 Curating BioMedical Knowledges and Omics Data

- Curate multi-omics data and knowledge from public databases and literatures for `Rare and complex diseases`.

### 🕸️ Building BioMedical Knowledge Graph

- Build a biomedical knowledge graph for drug repurposing and disease mechanism for `Rare and complex diseases`.
