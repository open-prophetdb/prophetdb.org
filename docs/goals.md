## 📝 Research Goals

- Find drug targets, disease mechanisms and biomarkers for rare diseases, such as ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc. 
- Find mechanisms and biomarkers for toxicology, such as drug toxicity, environmental toxicity, etc. such as PM2.5.

## 📚 Research Tasks

> Rare Disease: ME/CFS, Long Covid, ALS, etc.
> 
> Toxicology: Drug Toxicity, Environmental Toxicity, etc. such as PM2.5.

### 🧑‍🔬 Curation of BioMedical Knowledges and Omics Data

- Curate multi-omics data and knowledge from public databases and literatures for `rare diseases` and `toxicology`.

### 🕸️ Building of BioMedical Knowledge Graph

- Build a biomedical knowledge graph for drug repurposing, disease mechanism and biomarker screening for `rare diseases`.
- Build a knowledge graph for `toxicology`.
