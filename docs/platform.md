## üñ•Ô∏è Open-Source Projects from Our Lab

### üï∏Ô∏è A Platform for Drug Repurposing, Disease Mechanism, Toxicological Mechanism and Biomarker Screening

Such as Knowledge Graph, Omics Data Analyzer, QC Tools, Data Repo for BioMedical Models, DL Models etc.

|Title | Language | Description|
|--|--|--|
| [BioMedGPS](https://github.com/yjcyxky/biomedgps) | Rust, TypeScript, Python | A knowledge graph system with graph neural network for drug repurposing, disease mechanism and biomarker screening.|
| [Chat Publications](https://github.com/yjcyxky/chat-publications) | Python | Ask questions and get answers from publications.|

### üåê Online Quality Assessment Platform for Multi-omics Data

|Title | Description |
|--|--|
| [Quartet Data Portal](https://www.chinese-quartet.org/#/dashboard) | The Quartet Project provides publicly accessible multi-omics reference materials and practical tools to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of multi-omics results. Well-characterized multiomics reference materials and quality control metrics pertinent to precision medicine study purposes can be used to measure and mitigate technical variation, enabling more accurate cross-batch and cross-omics data integration in increasingly large-scale and longitudinal studies such as the International Human Phenome Project. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/chinese-quartet)|
