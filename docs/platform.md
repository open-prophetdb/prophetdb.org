### Online Quality Assessment Platform for Multi-omics Data

|Title | Description |
|--|--|
| [Quartet Data Portal](https://www.chinese-quartet.org/#/dashboard) | The Quartet Project provides publicly accessible multi-omics reference materials and practical tools to enhance the reproducibility and reliability of multi-omics results. Well-characterized multiomics reference materials and quality control metrics pertinent to precision medicine study purposes can be used to measure and mitigate technical variation, enabling more accurate cross-batch and cross-omics data integration in increasingly large-scale and longitudinal studies such as the International Human Phenome Project. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/chinese-quartet)|

### Multi-omics Data Management and Analysis Platform

|Title | Language | Description|
|--|--|--|
| [Choppy Pipe](https://github.com/yjcyxky/choppy-pipe) | Python | Choppy is a command-line & web tool for executing WDL workflows on Cromwell servers. (Based on widdler, but more.) |
| [BioMiner](https://github.com/yjcyxky/biominer) | Clojure, Vue | Online analysis platform for multi-omics data. |
| [BioMiner Indexd](https://github.com/yjcyxky/biominer-indexd) | Rust | Index engine for biomedical data files. We epect it will be a indexing engine for indexing high quality data, such as clinical data (EHR), multi-omics data, whole slide image, etc. |
